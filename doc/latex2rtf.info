1 Introduction
**************

 LaTeX2RTF  is a translator program from LaTeX  text into "rich text
format" files. These files are commonly referred to as RTF files. RTF
is a published standard format by Microsoft. This standard can be
ambiguous in places and Microsoft ignores parts of the standard it
finds inconvenient, but RTF is widely used by many WYSIWIG text
editors and is supported by Microsoft Word and most text processors.
 LaTeX2RTF  translates the text and as much of the formatting
information from LaTeX  to RTF. Be forewarned that the typeset output
is not nearly as good as what you would get from using LaTeX
directly. So, why bother translating? Consider, 
  1. You use LaTeX  and hate everything beginning with MS-....
     Nevertheless, you have to share your documents with people who
     don't even know that there are alternatives to MS-....       

  2. You know somebody who frequently sends you very fine LaTeX
     documents. Unfortunately, you are "on the other side" and need
     to import her files, steal some part, and then desktop publish
     it in your fine MS-... environment.       

  3. You like LaTeX  and BibTeX . You interact with the rest of the
     world. You know someone that wants to include your writing in a
     Word document. 
         There are drawbacks to the conversion process. In fact,
don't expect any LaTeX  file to be converted as you would like, don't
expect it to be converted without errors or warnings, and don't be
especially surprised when it doesn't convert at all.  LaTeX2RTF  is
known to have many bugs and many missing features. Paradoxically, this
number seems to grow more and more with each day.  However, we can
categorically state that there are some special cases in which a LaTeX
file will be translated to RTF satisfactorily by LaTeX2RTF  -- This
was sort of disclaimer, ok? OK!  LaTeX  is a system for typesetting
text and therefore it focuses on the logical structure of a document,
whilst RTF is meant to be a transport format for a family of Desktop
Publishing Software, dealing mostly with the design of a text. 
Although the commands and styles in LaTeX  are much more flexible and
standardized than in RTF, only a small subset of commands has been
implemented to date  (*note Unimplemented Features::).  Some of
the capabilities of LaTeX2RTF  are restricted in scope or buggy (*note
Known Bugs::).  RTF is a moving target, because Microsoft does not
stop inventing new extensions and features; consequently you cannot
view newer RTF files with older word processors.   The syntax and
semantics of RTF are somewhat artistic, i.e., you can generate a 
syntactically correct RTF file that cannot be displayed by some/most
word processors. For more details on RTF the specification consult
the links at `http://latex2rtf.sf.net/'

2.1 General
===========

 The documentation of the program is found in the `doc/' directory 
in the file `latex2rtf.texi' in the GNU TeXInfo format.   For your
convenience, you can find HTML and PDF  versions of the manual there
as well.
 Note: In this manual, the terms "directory" and "folder" are used
interchangeably.

2.2 Obtaining LaTeX2RTF

========================

 LaTeX2RTF  is available for many Unix Platforms, for the Macintosh,
and for MS-DOS,  including all versions of MS Windows.  The
latest version of LaTeX2RTF  is available at  SourceForge
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/)  and -- with some delay
-- on CTAN sites:  e.g., `http://www.dante.de' or
`http://www.ctan.org'.  The DOS package will also run under all MS
Windows versions except 64bit systems.  It requires an i386
processor or better.
 It should only be used on older Microsoft systems.
 For Win9x, ME, NT, or newer, you should use the win or win-NO-GUI
package.  The win-NO-GUI package is compiled with  MinGW (2.0.0
and up), and only runs under Win32  (Win9x, ME, NT, 2000, XP, 2003,
Vista). From version 2.0.0 up it also runs on 64bit systems.  The
win package is the win-NO-GUI package plus Win32 GUI program
(l2rshell).
 From version 2.0.0 up it also runs on 64bit systems.  The win64
package (LaTeX2RTF  1.9.19) is the win package but with 32bit
versions of the shell utilities so that it also runs on 64bit
systems.  There are a few people working on LaTeX2RTF , and some
more make  contributions, coordinated by Wilfried Hennings
(texconvfaq "at" gmx.de). See the SourceForge
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/)  project pages for the
latest news. 


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: UNIX,  Next: DOS or Windows,  Prev: Obtaining LaTeX2RTF,  Up: Installation

2.3 UNIX
========

 To install, 
  1. Edit `Makefile' for your local configuration.  In particular, pay
     attention to the `PREFIX' variable.  If you do not have root
     access you might wish  to set the makefile variable `PREFIX' to
     be your home directory.   On some machines the cc compiler
     will issue errors. Therefore the  default compiler command in
     the Makefile is `CC=gcc'. 

  2. As of version 1.9.13, LaTeX2RTF  supports conversion of LaTeX
     equations to bitmaps using the shell script `latex2png', found
     in `scripts/'.   `latex2png' requires that both LaTeX  and
     `ImageMagick' are installed.  LaTeX2RTF  will translate
     documents without a working `latex2png', but some features will
     be missing.  You can verify that the `latex2png' script is
     working by typing `make' in the `scripts/' directory. 

  3. `make'  If this is not your first time installation, you may
     want to preserve your old configuration (`*.cfg') files. Copy
     them to a safe place before installing.  On IBM AIX, the IBM
     make utility does not support some of the commands used in
     Makefile. In this case use `gmake' (from GNU) instead.  Sun
     has decided to support the XPG4 standard on Solaris by an
     alternative set of binaries.  To allow bitmap conversion of
     equations, two things are needed.  First, change the first line
     of latex2png to `#!/usr/xpg4/bin/sh' Second, define the
     XPG4_GREP environment variable accordingly, for bash-like shells
     `XPG4_GREP=/usr/xpg4/bin/grep; export XPG4_GREP' or for
     tsch-like shells `setenv XPG4_GREP /usr/xpg4/bin/grep'. 

  4. `make install'  If your `mkdir' doesn't support the `-p'
     option, then create the necessary directories by hand and remove
     the option from the `$MKDIR' variable. If you have other
     problems, just copy `latex2rtf' and `latex2png' to a binary
     directory, and move the contents of the `cfg/' directory to the
     location specified by `$CFG_INSTALL'.  

  5. `make check'  [OPTIONAL] This tests LaTeX2RTF  on a variety of
     LaTeX  files.  Expect a whole lot of warnings, but no outright
     errors. (On IBM AIX, use `gmake check'.) Note that this will
     check the basic functionality of the `latex2png' script, and
     then that of `latex2rtf'. 

  6. `make install-info'  [OPTIONAL] This installs `.info' files
     for use with the `info' program. 
         You no longer need to define the environment variable
`RTFPATH'. This is only necessary if you move the directory
containing the `.cfg' files.   Just define `RTFPATH' to be the path
for the new location of the `cfg' directory.

2.4 DOS
=======

 The UNIX and Mac packages do not contain an executable for DOS  or
Windows. You may compile it yourself (with djgpp or MinGW) or get the
 DOS package as file `latex2rtf-x.x.x_dos.zip' (where x.x.x is the
version number)
 or the Windows package as file `latex2rtf-x.x.x_win-NO-GUI.zip'
(no installer, no GUI)
 or file `latex2rtf-x.x.x_win.zip' (with installer and GUI)
 from SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/)
  The DOS distribution contains a precompiled executable  which
should run under plain DOS and also in the command prompt  (or
"console") of any MS Windows system including Vista but not on 64bit
systems.
  To install the DOS or Windows package of LaTeX2RTF , extract all
files  from the zip archive, preserving the folder structure 
(winzip: check "use folder names"), preferably to `C:\l2r', or under
Windows, to your "Program Files"  folder (which ever it is named in
your system) because then it will find its cfg files by default.
 If you extracted them to another folder (e.g. `C:\my_files\l2r'),
either edit the file `L2RPREP.BAT'  and change the folder `C:\l2r' to
where you put them, or specify the  path to the cfg folder in the
command line.
 Avoid blanks in folder and file names!  Make sure that the
folder containing the file `L2RPREP.BAT'   is in your search path, or
put this file into a folder  which is in your search path.
 To display the current search path, enter `PATH'  from the command
prompt (with no arguments).  Under plain DOS, conversion of
equations or figures to bitmaps is not  possible because Ghostscript
and ImageMagick are not available for plain DOS.  


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Win32 systems,  Next: Macintosh,  Prev: DOS or Windows,  Up: Installation

2.5 Win32 systems
=================

 To install LaTeX2RTF  on a Win32 system (WinNT, Win2000, WinXP, 
WinVista), download the win package, execute the
`latex2rtf-x.x.x_win.exe'  (where x.x.x is the version number) and
follow the instructions.  Note: The installer and GUI shell do not
support Win9x and WinMe since LaTeX2RTF  v.1.9.17.  If you have one
of these systems, you should use the  win-NO-GUI package (1.9.19 and
up) of LaTeX2RTF .   To start the program double-click the LaTeX2RTF
icon,  or drag and drop a `.tex' file onto the icon.  If your
LaTeX  document refers to external graphic files, e.g. eps,  or you
want to use the option to convert equations to bitmaps, you must have
LaTeX, ImageMagick and Ghostscript installed. These programs are 
freely available for download at `http://www.miktex.org/', 
`http://www.imagemagick.org' and `http://www.ghostscript.com'  The
following versions were available at the time of writing  and used
together with LaTeX2RTF  version 2.0.0 and 2.1.0:
 - MikTeX 2.8
 - Ghostscript 8.70
 - ImageMagick-6.5.7-3-Q8-windows-dll.exe   If MikTeX,
ImageMagick and Ghostscript are installed, the paths to their 
executables are detected automatically. If for any reason this doesn't
 happen, these paths can be specified manually in the "Environment" 
tab of the LaTeX2RTF  GUI shell window.  If you need to start
LaTeX2RTF  not from its own shell but from another  Windows
application, you need to add the folder containing  the latex2png
script and the helper programs to the search path.
 Some applications (e.g. Lyx) allow to temporarily add the path by
specifying it in the options.
 If this is not possible, you can add the latex2rtf folder to
Windows' default path like follows:  To add a folder - e.g.
C:\Program Files\latex2rtf - to the search path:
   * Note that the folder name "Program Files" contains a blank. This
     would lead to some problems as some parts of the latex2rtf program
      package interpret the blank as a parameter delimiter.
     Therefore in the following example the folder name "Program Files"
     is replaced by its DOS equivalent "PROGRA~1" which has the
     additional effect that this is similar for several if not all
     European languages.
     

   * Win95, Win98, WinME
        * Open the file `C:\Autoexec.bat' either with Edit (DOS) or 
          with Notepad (Windows).

        * At the end of that file, add the line
          `PATH=C:\PROGRA~1\latex2rtf;%PATH%' 

        * Save the file to its original location. Shutdown and reboot
          the PC.
          

   * WinNT, Win2000, WinXP
        * Right-click "My Computer" (German: "Arbeitsplatz"), then
          select "Properties";

        * NT: Click the "Environment" tab;
           XP: Click the "Extended" tab, then the "Environment
          variables" button;

        * Find the line beginning with `PATH=' and insert the string
           `C:\PROGRA~1\latex2rtf;'
           so that the complete line looks like
           `PATH=C:\PROGRA~1\latex2rtf;C:\WINDOWS;...'

        * Click "OK"
 Either the folders where TeX, ImageMagick and Ghostscript are
installed must also be in your search path, or you must edit the file
`L2RPREP.BAT',  ensure that the pathes in this file point to the
folders where  TeX, ImageMagick and Ghostscript are installed on your
machine, and call `L2RPREP' before calling `latex2rt'.
 Or you edit `L2R.BAT' and call `L2R' instead of calling
`LATEX2RT.EXE'.  When equations are to be converted to bitmaps, for
each equation LaTeX2RTF  first writes a temporary l2r_nnnn.tex file
to disk which consists  of only the equation to be converted. It then
sends the call  for `"bash latex2png l2r_nnnn.tex"' to the operating
system.
 In previous versions of latex2rtf, some users got the message 
"Out of environment space" (can occur only under Windows 95, Windows 98
 or Windows ME); this should be solved now  by using bash.exe
instead of command.com.

2.6 Macintosh
=============

 If you want a MacOS X version, make sure that you have installed the
developer tools CD that is appropriate for your OS version, and then
follow the directions above for a UNIX installation.  Alternatively
you can install using fink `http://fink.sourceforge.net/' or as an
i-installer package  `http://www.rna.nl/ii.html'.  As of
2006-01-30 there also is a GUI shell for Macintosh.
 See `http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/fischerk/LaTeX2rtf/index.html'
 There is a PPC port of an old version 1.9k for Classic MacOS
LaTeX2RTF .  To convert a LaTeX  file using this version,  drag the
file onto the LaTeX2RTF  icon.  The translation is best if there are
`.aux' and `.bbl' files in the same folder as the `.tex' file to be
converted.  These should be generated using LaTeX  and `bibtex'.

2.7 Problems Compiling
======================

 The code for LaTeX2RTF  is standard ANSI C.  Some possible pitfalls
are
   * Not correctly defining your compiler in the Makefile. The
     default is to use `gcc'.   

   * Encountering errors because the compiler options.  During
     development all compiler warnings are turned on.  However,
     different compilers have different interpretations of `-Wall'
     and  may generate errors that were not found in a different
     development system.  Please report these, but a quick fix is to
     remove all compiler options.

2.8 Problems with `make check'
==============================

 All the files in the `test' directory are converted (with varying
degrees of success) using LaTeX2RTF  and are tested before most CVS
check-ins and with all released tarballs.  There will be many warning
messages, but there should be no actual error messages.  If you do
not have a working latex2png script, then some of the files will fail
to be translated.

File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: General Assumptions,  Next: LaTeX2RTF Options,  Prev: Using LaTeX2RTF,  Up: Using LaTeX2RTF

3.1 General Assumptions
=======================

 LaTeX2RTF  assumes that the `.tex' file you want to convert is a
valid  LaTeX  document.  The chances of a successful LaTeX2RTF
conversion are slightly better than the proverbial snowball's if the
`.tex' file doesn't `latex' properly.  Use  LaTeX  to find and
correct errors before using LaTeX2RTF .  To correctly convert font
names you must edit the `fonts.cfg' configuration file. This file is
used to specify the needed font names and how the LaTeX  default font
names should be converted to RTF (*note Font Configuration::). LaTeX
variables and user defined commands are not evaluated. They will be
simply ignored. To let LaTeX2RTF  know the names of variables you can
add them in the `ignore.cfg' file (*note Ignore Command::).  The
environment variable RTFPATH may contain a search path for the support
files (all files ending in `.cfg'). If no file is found during the
search in the search-path or if the environment variable is not set,
the compiled-in default for the configuration-file directory is used.
If the files are not found at all the program aborts.  In the DOS
and Windows versions the search path is separated by `;' in the Unix
version by `:'. For the paths themselves apply `\' and `/'. A
separator may appear at the beginning or ending of RTFPATH.  Make
sure that the configuration files are in the correct directory (or
folder). LaTeX2RTF  will need at least `fonts.cfg', `direct.cfg',
`ignore.cfg', `english.cfg'. You may have to change one ore more of
them to suit your needs (*note Configuration::).  *Note Missing
options::, for actual implementations irregularities.  *Note
Reporting Bugs::, for information on how to reach the maintainer.

3.2 LaTeX2RTF
 Options
======================

 The LaTeX2RTF  command converts a LaTeX  file into RTF text format.
The text and much of the formatting information is translated to RTF
making the new file look similar to the original.  The command line
syntax is: 
     latex2rtf [-options] inputfile[.tex]
    or for the DOS and Windows versions: 
     latex2rt [-options] inputfile[.tex]
    The `-options' may consist of one or more of the following 
`-a auxfile'
     specify an `.aux' file (for table and figure references) that
     differs from `inputfile.aux'. If this is omitted, the name of the
     inputfile with the suffix replaced `.aux''will be taken.  You
     must provide both files (`.tex' and the `.aux') to be able to
     convert cross-references in a LaTeX  file.  The `.aux' is created
     by running the `inputfile.tex' through `latex'. 

`-b bblfile'
     Unless an `bblfile' is specified with the `-b' option, LaTeX2RTF
     uses a `inputfile.bbl'.  The `bblfile' file is used for
     citations and is typically created by running `inputfile.aux'
     through `bibtex'. 

`-C codepage'
     used to specify the character set (code page) used in the LaTeX
     document. This is only important when non-ansi characters are
     included in the LaTeX  document. Typically this is done in a
     LaTeX2e  file by using `\usepackage[codepage]{inputenc}' and in
     this case you need not specify the -C codepage option. If NO
     `\usepackage[codepage]{inputenc}' is in the LaTeX2e  file, you
     must inform the converter about the codepage by the -C codepage
     option. You may select any of the following code pages: ansinew,
     applemac, cp437, cp437de, cp850, cp852, cp865, decmulti, cp1250,
     cp1252, latin1, latin2, latin3, latin4, latin5, latin9, next.
     The default behavior is to use ansinew (code page 1252).
     Cyrillic support includes conversion of koi8-r, koi8-u, cp1251,
     cp855, cp866, maccyr, and macukr encodings. 

`-d debug_level'
     The `-d' option determines the amount of debugging information to
     send to stderr while translating. debug_level=0 means only
     Errors, `1' Warning Messages (default) also.  The debug_level
     can go as high as `7' for insane amounts of  debugging fun. 

`-D dots_per_inch'
     used to specify the number of dots per inch for equations
     converted to bitmaps.   This value is also used when picture
     environments are converted to bitmaps as well as when EPS
     graphics are converted to png files.  The default value is 300
     dots per inch. 

`-f#'
     where # selects which fields to use during conversion:
    `-f0'
          do not use fields in RTF.  This is handy when primitive RTF 
             editors are being used to view the RTF output.

    `-f1'
          use fields for equations but not `\ref' and `\cite'.  

    `-f2'
          use fields for `\ref' and `\cite' but not equations.  This
            will be useful for versions of OpenOffice that import
          cross-references     properly (as of Sept 2003 in a
          soon-to-be released version) but do not properly     handle
          fields in equations.

    `-f3'
          use fields when possible.  This is the default and is most
          useful when     the RTF file is being exported to be used
          in Word.  This retains the most     information from the
          original LaTeX  file.
     

`-F'
     use LaTeX to create bitmaps for all figures.  This may help when
     figures are not translated properly with the default settings.
     This typically requires  a functional version of ImageMagick on
     your machine to work properly. 

`-h'
     a short usage description 

`-i language'
     used to set the idiom or language used by the LaTeX  document.
     Typically, this is specified in a LaTeX2e  document by including
     `\usepackage[language]{babel}' where `language' is one of the
     languages supported by the `babel' package.   All languages
     listed in the babel system are supported so far as translations
     for "Chapter," "References," and the like.  Furthermore, some
     commands found in the style files for german, french, russian,
     and czech style are supported (*note Language Configuration::).
     

`-l'
     same as `-i latin1' (Note that the default behavior is to use
     `ansinew' which is a superset of `latin1'). Included for
     backwards compatibility. 

`-M#'
     where # selects the type of equation conversion.  Use
    `-M1'
          convert displayed equations to RTF

    `-M2'
          convert inline equations to RTF

    `-M4'
          convert displayed equations to bitmap

    `-M8'
          convert inline equations to bitmap

    `-M16'
          insert Word comment field that contains the original equation
          text

    `-M32'
          insert the raw latex equation delimited by `<<:' and `:>>'.
          This     is potential useful when using version 6 of the
          MathType equation editor,     which converts typed or
          pasted TeX code into a MathType equation.
               Probably this could also be useful for use in
          OpenOffice, as OO has an      equation syntax which
          partially resembles TeX syntax.
          These switches can be combined to get different effects.
     Handy examples are
    `-M3'
          convert both inline and displayed equations to RTF (default)

    `-M6'
          convert inline equations to RTF and displayed equations to
          bitmaps

    `-M12'
          convert both inline and displayed equations to bitmaps
     Bitmap conversion requires that you have installed a working
     latex2png script. Producing bitmaps is slow.
      When running the DOS version, conversion to bitmaps works for
     the first 26 equations but fails for the rest with the message
      "latex2png: pipe error: Too many open files (EMFILE)".
      This is probably a bug in the djgpp 2.04 compiler; I chose this
     version because of its better support of long filenames under
     Win32 (95, 98, ME, 2000, XP, Vista).
      The Windows version, compiled with Cygwin in MinGW mode,
     successfully  converts at least 79 equations to bitmaps. 

`-o outputfile'
     Unless an `outputfile' is specified with the `-o' option, the
     resulting RTF filename is formed by removing `.tex' from the
     `inputfile' and appending `.rtf'. 

`-p'
     Escape parentheses in mathematical formulas.  This has no effect
     unless EQ fields are being generated.  When this option is used,
     then in a `(' or `)' that appears in an EQ field will be
     preceeded by a backslash.  Despite documentation to the contrary
     (which says that all parentheses should be escaped), adding
     escapes usually produces a worse result than doing nothing. If
     Word displays some formulas with  parentheses as "Error!", you
     might try this option as a last resort. See also the -S option.
      This is an option because it will break typesetting equations
     with non-matching parentheses (because an unmatched unquoted
     parenthesis would terminate the field). 

`-P /path/to/cfg'
     used to specify the folder (i.e. directory) that contains the
     `.cfg' files  and/or the folder that contains the latex2png
     script.
      Unix, Mac: The folder that contains the latex2png script must
     be prepended  by a ":".
      DOS, Windows: The scripts folder is not used, the  scripts
     are always taken from the search path, therefore the folder 
     containing the scripts and the helper programs must be the first
     in the search path.  You can either add it to the search path
     permanently or add it temporarily by  calling l2rprep.bat before
     starting conversions.
      If any of the folder names contains a blank, the folder string
     must be  enclosed in single (Unix, Mac) or double (DOS, Windows)
     quotes.
      Examples:
      (Unix:) `latex2rtf -P ./cfg/:./scripts/ foo'
      (DOS/Windows:) `latex2rt -P "C:\Program Files\latex2rtf\cfg"
     foo'
      Note that without specifying the -P option, LaTeX2RTF  tries to
     find its cfg files  in the following locations:
      1. the folder specified by the environment variable `RTFPATH',
     if this variable exists;
      2. The folder `%PROGRAMFILES%\latex2rtf\cfg', if the variable 
     `PROGRAMFILES' exists - this is the folder in which LaTeX2RTF  is
     installed  by the Windows GUI installer with default settings;
      3. the folder specified at compilation time by the variable
     `CFGDIR'. This is set in the Makefile. The DOS version is
     compiled with `CFGDIR=C:/l2r', the Windows version with 
     `CFGDIR=C:/PROGRA~1/latex2rtf'. 

`-se#'
     selects the scale for equation conversion, where # is the scale
     factor  (default 1.00). 

`-sf#'
     selects the scale for figure conversion, where # is the scale
     factor (default 1.00). 

`-t#'
     where # selects the type of table conversion.  Use
    `-t1'
          convert tables to RTF (default)

    `-t2'
          convert tables to bitmaps
     

`-v or -V'
     prints version information on standard output and exits. 

`-S'
     used to specify that semicolons should be used to separate
     arguments in RTF fields (instead of commas).  Typically this is
     needed when the machine that opens the RTF file has a version of
     Windows that uses `,' for decimal points. 

`-T /path/to/tmp'
     used to specify the folder where to put temporary files. Not used
     by the DOS and Windows versions. 

`-W'
     includes warnings directly in the RTF file 

`-Z#'
     add the specified number of extra `}' to the end of the RTF file.
     This is useful for files that are not cleanly converted by
     LaTeX2RTF . 
    With no arguments other than switches starting with a "-", 
LaTeX2RTF  acts as a filter, i.e., it reads from `stdin' and writes 
to `stdout'. In addition, diagnostic messages are sent to `stderr' or
 (DOS and Windows versions) also to `stdout'. If these standard
channels are not redirected using `<' and `>', then the input is read
from the command line, and both output and error messages are printed
on the screen.  If a non-switch argument is present, LaTeX2RTF
assumes it is the name of the input file. The file must have
extension ".tex" but the extension is optional. The output file is
constructed from the input file name by removing the extension ".tex"
and adding ".rtf".

3.3 Debugging
=============

 With the `-d' option you can specify how much processing
information LaTeX2RTF  reports. If there is a logfile specified the
output goes to this file. Nonetheless Warnings and Errors are logged
to stderr always.  Possible values of `-d' are
  0. only errors.

  1. Translation Warnings (default).

  2. shows preparsing of sections

  3. Reasonably high level debugging messages

  4. Show all function calls

  5. Show each character as it is processed

  6. Show processing of characters as they are output as well

4.1 LaTeX2e
===========

 LaTeX2RTF  understands most of the commands introduced with LaTeX2e
.  It translates both the old 2.09 version of
`\documentstyle[options]{format#}' and the newer
`\documentclass[options]{format}'.   


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Unicode Support,  Next: Input Encoding,  Prev: LaTeX2e,  Up: Features

4.2 Unicode Support
===================

 As of version 1.9.17, LaTeX2RTF  has limited unicode support.  LaTeX
files that use unicode sequences are just emitted directly into the
RTF file.
 Symbols and odd characters in math sequences may also be converted
to a unicode sequence. Some of them need the STIXGeneral fonts 
(see *Note Math and Special Symbols::) to be installed on the system 
where the rtf file is to be displayed or printed.   Support for
unicode encoded input  is activated by the LaTeX  command
 `\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}'
 or
 `\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}'.  


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Input Encoding,  Next: Language Support,  Prev: Unicode Support,  Up: Features

4.3 Input Encoding
==================

 It is not necesary to specify the `-C' option if you use
`\usepackage{isolatin1}' or `\documentstyle[isolatin1]{...}'.
LaTeX2RTF  automagically detects these packages/style options and
switches to processing of ISO-Latin1 codes.  The following encodings
are supported: ansinew, applemac, cp437, cp437de, cp850, cp852, cp865,
decmulti, cp1250, cp1252, latin1, latin2, latin3, latin4, latin5,
latin9, next, koi8-r, koi8-u, cp1251, cp855, cp866, maccyr, macukr,
utf8, and utf8x.  The encoding used in RTF files is cp1252.  If
cyrillic fonts are present, then these are represented in the RTF
file using cp1251 (Windows Cyrillic). 


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Language Support,  Next: Cross References,  Prev: Input Encoding,  Up: Features

4.4 Language Support
====================

 The following languages from the Babel package are supported:
afrikaans, german, nynorsk, spanish, bahasa, dutch, icelandic,
polish, swedish, basque, english, portuges, turkish, brazil,
esperanto, irish, romanian, usorbian, breton, estonian, italian,
samin, welsh, catalan, finnish, latin, scottish, croatian, lsorbian,
serbian, czech, french, magyar, slovak, danish, galician, norsk,
slovene.  The only thing that these files do is to translate
various words usually emitted by LaTeX  during processing.  For
example, this ensures that the LaTeX2RTF  will provide the correct
translation of the word "Chapter" in the converted document.  You
can select any of the above languages using the `-l' option.  This is
not needed if your LaTeX  file contains
`\usepackage[language]{babel}'.  Encountering the `german' package
or documentstyle option (by H. Partl of the Vienna University) makes
LaTeX2RTF  behave like that: German Quotes, German Umlauts by `"a',
etc....  This support is programmed directly  into LaTeX2RTF  and
supporting similar features for other languages will require 
patching the source code.  There is similar support for `french'
packages.  There is reasonable support for english, latin1, latin2,
and cyrillic languages.  *Note Language Configuration::, for
details on how to write a `language.cfg' file for your language by
yourself. 


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Cross References,  Next: Page Formatting,  Prev: Language Support,  Up: Features

4.5 Cross References
====================

 Cross references include everything that you might expect and then
some: bibliographic citations, equation references, table references,
figure  references, and section references.  Section, equation, table
and figure references are implemented by placing RTF bookmarks around
the equation number (or table number or figure number).    Page
references work but are implemented as "warm" cross-references.  This
means that Word does not automatically update the page references when
the file is opened.  To update the page references you must select
the entire document (in Word) and press `F9'.  Bibliographic
references currently require that a valid `.aux' file be present.
This is where LaTeX2RTF  obtains the reference numbers.  It would be
nice if LaTeX2RTF  just automatically numbered the references when
there was no `.aux' file, but LaTeX2RTF  does not do this yet.   LaTeX2RTF
relies on BibTeX  to convert and format bibliographic entries.
Usually the style file for a particular BibTeX  format does not use
any special LaTeX  commands and therefore the bibliography file
`file.bbl' can be processed by LaTeX2RTF  without difficulty. As a
consequence, LaTeX2RTF  can handle most bibliography styles without
problem.  There are several latex style packages that add
additional latex commands to enhance bibliographic formatting.
LaTeX2RTF  currently supports the following bibliographic packages:
 apacite, apalike, authordate, harvard, natbib (also with apanat1b).
These packages have many, many options and you may encounter problems
with formatting in special cases.  As of LaTeX2RTF  1.9.17, the
natbib command bibpunct is supported.  Footnotes are implemented
and appear at the bottom of each page.    Indexing is
reasonably-well supported.  The simple mark-up of `makeindex'
     \index{topic!subtopic@\textit{subtopic}}
   is supported.  The rest of the fancy indexing stuff is not
implemented. The index is created at the location of the
`\printindex' command. When a file with an index is first opened in
Word, you must select the  entire file and update the page references
and fields by pressing `F9'.  Currently, there is no support for
`\labels' of `\item's in enumerate environments.  The conversion of
cross-references is not perfect because of the different mechanisms
in the LaTeX  and Word worlds.  In particular, if there are  multiple
`\label' in a figure, table, or section environment then only the
first gets processed.  It is also possible to confuse the LaTeX2RTF
in eqnarray environments.

4.6 Page Formatting
===================

 LaTeX2RTF  will handle some basic page formatting options,
including \doublespacing (as implemented in the setspace package),
and the margin setting options provided by the geometry package
including commands in the ratio, centering and margin families. Not
all geometry options are implemented yet, in part because there are
no corresponding rtf commands for many of them. 


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Equations,  Next: Math and Special Symbols,  Prev: Page Formatting,  Up: Features

4.7 Equations
=============

 There are five separate levels of equation translation based on the
-M switch,  see *Note LaTeX2RTF Options::. Each equation is now
converted either to an EQ field or to a bitmap  or inserted as raw
TeX code in the document.   This is an interim solution (for some
definition of "interim").  Ideally the equations would become OLE
equation objects in the RTF file, but this needs to be implemented.
 Some functions in the EQ fields have two or more parameters with a
separator  between each two. Unfortunately, the interpretation of
these separators depends  on the country specific settings in the MS
Windows system in which the rtf file  is opened. E.g. in English
versions of MS Windows, the default parameter separator  is the
comma, in German versions the default is the semicolon. If the
parameter  in the RTF file does not match the Windows setting, some
EQ fields are not  interpreted correctly. You can check and set the
separator in [Windows control panel  - country settings - numbers -
list separator]. By default, LaTeX2RTF  uses the comma as separator.
If LaTeX2RTF  is called with the command line parameter -S , the
semicolon is inserted as parameter delimiter.   Theoretically,
according to the Word help file, parentheses `(' or `)' in 
mathematical formulas should be escaped (by a preceding backslash). 
Despite this, adding escapes usually produces a worse result than doing
nothing. If Word displays some formulas with parentheses as "Error!",
you might try  the -p option as a last resort.  It is also
possible to convert an EQ field generated by LaTeX2RTF  to an
Equation Editor object by opening the rtf file in Word and
double-clicking on the equation. However there are bugs in the
interface between Word and Equation  Editor which prevent symbols in
font Symbol or MTExtra to be converted correctly.  The full
commercial version of the Equation Editor, called MathType, handles
this conversion correctly. If you have MathType version 6, an even
better way to convert LaTeX  equations to MathType is letting
LaTeX2RTF  write the LaTeX  code of the equations verbatim in the 
rtf file (option -M32), then open the rtf file in Word, select the LaTeX
code of  an equation, cut it to the clipboard, open MathType, and
paste the code. MathType will convert the code into an equation.
Wilfried tried to automate this  in a Word macro, but this fails
because the macro does not wait until MathType is started and ready
to receive the pasted code. Maybe the MathType authors will  give us
a hint or provide such a macro.
 MathType can be downloaded from
`http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype/'  (30 day test
version). 


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Math and Special Symbols,  Next: Tables,  Prev: Equations,  Up: Features

4.8 Math and Special Symbols
============================

 The way that symbols are converted in the RTF is based on the
following observations.  If the symbol is found in the latin 1
character set, then the current font is used, else the unicode code
is inserted in the rtf code. (Implemented since version 2.1.0) 
The means that on the system where the `.rtf' file is opened, a
unicode font should be available or these glyphs will not be
displayed correctly.  As only the STIX fonts (see *Note Math and
Special Symbols::)  contain all needed characters, these fonts should
be  installed on the system where the rtf file is to be displayed or
printed.   Many mathematical and special symbols are directly
supported by LaTeX2RTF . Less common symbols (not found in the
standard font) are supported by the conversion table in the file
`direct.cfg',  see *Note Direct Conversion::.   Required fonts
are: 
     

   * "Times" / "Times New Roman" or "Helvetica" / "Arial", 
     preferably with Unicode extension (i.e. supporting all European
     languages  including Cyrillic, Greek, and Hebrew). "Times" or
     "Times New Roman" and  "Helvetica" or "Arial" are standard on
     all systems,  but not their Unicode extension. 

   * "STIXGeneral" (4 fonts in plain, italic, bold, bold-italic). These
     fonts  are available from
     `http://www.mozilla.org/projects/mathml/fonts/' or from
     `http://latex2rtf.sourceforge.net/'  
    


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Tables,  Next: Graphics,  Prev: Math and Special Symbols,  Up: Features

4.9 Tables
==========

 Conversion of tabular and tabbing environments is somewhat lame.
The  main difficulty is that LaTeX  (and html) will size the columns
of a table automatically.  There is no such feature in RTF.
Consequently, the conversion defaults to making all the columns have
equal size.  This is suboptimal and should be revised.
 Another way is to use the option -t2 to make latex render them as
bitmaps and insert the bitmaps into the RTF file. This feature was
added in version 1.9.19. 


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Graphics,  Next: Pagestyles,  Prev: Tables,  Up: Features

4.10 Graphics
=============

 There is now rudimentary support for `\includegraphics'.   Three
file types will be inserted into the RTF file without needing 
conversion: `.pict', `.jpeg', and `.png' files.   EPS and PDF files
are converted to PNG using `convert' from the  ImageMagick package.
Some options are even handled properly. 


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Pagestyles,  Next: Hyperlatex,  Prev: Graphics,  Up: Features

4.11 Pagestyles
===============

 If there is no `\pagestyle' command, the RTF output is generated as
with  plain pagestyle, i.e. each page has its page number centered at
the bottom.  You must turn this off with the \pagestyle{empty}
command in  the LaTeX  file if you don't want pagenumbers. The
headings and myheadings styles are silently ignored by now. The
twosided option to the \documentstyle or \documentclass produces the
corresponding RTF tokens. Note that these features require RTF
Version 1.4. 


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Hyperlatex,  Next: APA Support,  Prev: Pagestyles,  Up: Features

4.12 Hyperlatex
===============

 Hyperlatex support is largely broken at the moment, but continues to
improve.  Otfried Schwarzkopf has created the "Hyperlatex Markup
Language" which is a "little package that allows you to use LaTeX  to
prepare documents in HTML." It brings an Emacs lisp program with it
to convert the Hyperlatex file to HTML. Hyperlatex can be obtained
from the CTAN-sites, see *Note Obtaining LaTeX2RTF::. There are two
convenient commands that avoid typing: \link and \xlink that generate
an "internal" label which then is used in the following \Ref and
\Pageref commands.  LaTeX  makes it possible to write
`\link{anchor}[ltx]{label}', which typesets: `anchor ltx'. LaTeX2RTF
does NOT support this aproach since the optional parameter is thrown
away right now, see *Note LaTeX2RTF under Development::.  Note that
you have to update your `.cfg' files if you are upgrading, since
there are a lot of HTML oriented commands in Hyperlatex that we simply
can `ignore'. 


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: APA Support,  Prev: Hyperlatex,  Up: Features

4.13 APA Support
================

 Some APA citation styles are supported, see *Note Citation
Commands::   Support for APA text formatting is only rudimentary at
the moment (headings without numbering).  If you want to format a
document according to APA, rename cfg/style.cfg to style_sav.cfg 
and rename cfg/styleAPA.cfg to style.cfg before starting LaTeX2RTF .

5.1 Input processing
====================

 On processing input LaTeX2RTF  first converts the LaTeX  special
characters. If it encounters one of the standard commands it is
converted internally. If a command is not known to LaTeX2RTF  it is
first looked up in `direct.cfg' and the RTF code specified there is
output. If not found there it is looked up in the section
`ignore.cfg'. This file includes a lot of LaTeX  commands that do not
affect the output (cross reference information and the like), or that
we are not able or willing to convert to RTF.  You can use
`ignore.cfg' if you get tired of seeing 
     WARNING: command: `foo' not found - ignored
    and you don't need `foo' in your RTF document. It would be nice
to send your additions to the LaTeX2RTF  mailing list for inclusion
in later distributions.  LaTeX2RTF  accepts Unix, MS-DOS, and
Macintosh line ending codes (\n, \r\n and \r).  The files it creates
get the line ending for the platform on which LaTeX2RTF  was
compiled.  The LaTeX  file may have been created with a wide
variety of character sets.  If the LaTeX  lacks the
`\package[codepage]{inputenc}' definition, then you may need to use
the command line switch to manually select the proper code page
(*note Input Encoding::).

5.2 Conditional Parsing
=======================

 Starting with LaTeX2RTF  1.9.18, there is a handy method for
controlling which content should be processed by LaTeX  or by
LaTeX2RTF .  Control is achieved using the standard `\if' facility of
TeX.  If you include the following line in the preamble of your
document (i.e., before `\begin{document}') 
     \newif\iflatextortf
    Then you will create a new `\iflatextortf' command in LaTeX .  
TeX sets the value of this to `false' by default.  Now, LaTeX2RTF
internally sets `\iflatextortf' to be true, and to ensure that this
is always the case, LaTeX2RTF  ignores the command `\latextortffalse'.
This means that you can control how different applications process
your document by  
     \iflatextortf
     This code is processed only by latex2rtf
     \else
     This code is processed only by latex
     \fi
    Note that `\iflatextortf' will only work within a section; you
cannot use this command to conditionally parse code that crosses
section boundaries. Also, it will only work on complete table or
figure environments. Due to the mechanism used by LaTeX2RTF  in
processing these environments, at this time the only way to
conditionally parse tables and figures is to include two complete
versions of the environment in question, nested within an appropriate
`\iflatex2rtf' structure.  LaTeX2RTF  versions 1.9.15 to 1.9.18 had
the ability to hide contents from LaTeX  but expose them to LaTeX2RTF
by starting a line with `%latex2rtf:'.  This code was horribly
broken, and it was removed.  The same functionality is readily
achieved using the `\iflatextortf' mechanism.  For example, the old
method allowed  
     %latex2rtf: This line will only appear in the latex2rtf output, 
   To get the same behavior, define `\iflatextortf' and use 
     \iflatextortf
     This code is processed only by latex2rtf
     \fi

5.3 Output Formatting
=====================

 On writing output, LaTeX2RTF  generates the operating system
specific line ending code (`\n' on Unix, `\r\n' on DOS or Windows),
depending on which system LaTeX2RTF  was compiled. As both should
be legal to any RTF Reader the resulting RTF rendering should not be
affected.  LaTeX2RTF  does not offer a whole lot of flexibility in
how files are translated, but it does offer some.  This flexibility
resides in four files `direct.cfg', `ignore.cfg', `fonts.cfg', and
`language.cfg'.  These filese are documented in the next four
sections. 


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Direct Conversion,  Next: Ignore Command,  Prev: Output Formatting,  Up: Configuration

5.4 Direct Conversion
=====================

 The file `direct.cfg' is used for converting LaTeX  commands by
simple text replacement. The format consists of lines with a LaTeX
command with backslash followed by comma. The rest of the line until
a `.' character will be written to the RTF file when the command is
found in the LaTeX  file. Lines starting with a `#' character are
ignored. After the `.' everything is ignored to end of line. To
select a specific font use `*fontname*', where  `fontname' be defined
in `fonts.cfg'. To write the `*' character use `**'.  

\bigstar,{\u8727**}.
\copyright,\'a9.
  In general, specific fonts should not be specified in this file.
There is a  mechanism to do this, but it turns out that this is not
as useful as originally thought.  The main reason that this fails is
because the conversion of equations from Word fields to Equation
Editor objects is buggy.  The consequence is that to have symbols
show up properly, they must be encoded differently when the Symbol
and MT Extra fonts are used -- depending on whether Word fields are
active or  not.  It was all very tedious to figure out a mechanism
that was "least broken." 


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Ignore Command,  Next: Font Configuration,  Prev: Direct Conversion,  Up: Configuration

5.5 Ignore Command
==================

 The file `ignore.cfg' is used for defining how to ignore specific
commands. This file is used for recognition of LaTeX  variables, user
defined variables, and some simple commands. All variables are
ignored but the converter must know the names to correctly ignore
assignments to variables. Lines in this file consist of a variable
name with backslash, followed by comma and the type of the variable
followed by `.'. Possible types are 
`NUMBER'
     simple numeric value

`MEASURE'
     numeric value with following unit of measure

`OTHER'
     ignores anything to the first character after `=' and from there
     to next space. e.g., `\setbox\bak=\hbox'

`COMMAND'
     ignores anything to next `\' and from there to the occurence of
     anything but a letter e.g., `\newbox\bak'

`SINGLE'
     ignores single command e.g., `\noindent'

`PARAMETER'
     ignores a command with one parameter e.g., `\foo{bar}'

`PACKAGE'
     does not produce a Warning message if PACKAGE is encountered,
     e.g., ``\kleenex,PACKAGE.'' ignores ``\usepackage{kleenex}''

`ENVCMD'
     intended to process contents of unknown environment as if it were
      plain LaTeX , e.g. ``\environ,ENVCMD.''
      Therefore ``\begin{environ} text \end{environ}'' would be
     converted to `text'. Doesn't work in LaTeX2RTF  version 2.1.0.

`ENVIRONMENT'
     ignores contents of that environment, e.g., with
     ``\ifhtml,ENVIRONMENT.'", ``\begin{ifhtml} text \end{ifhtml}''
     ignores `text'.
    The types are in upper case exactly as above. Do not use spaces.
Lines starting with a `#' character are ignored. After the `.'
everything is ignored to end of line. Example:
     \pagelength,MEASURE.
   


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Font Configuration,  Next: Language Configuration,  Prev: Ignore Command,  Up: Configuration

5.6 Font Configuration
======================

 The file `fonts.cfg' contains the font name mapping.  For example,
this file determines what font is used to represent `\rm' characters
in the RTF file.    A line consists of a font name in LaTeX
followed by comma and a font name in RTF. The end is marked by a `.'.
No spaces are allowed. The LaTeX  font will be converted to the RTF
font when it is found in the LaTeX  file. If multiple translations
for the same LaTeX  font are specified, only the first is used. All
fonts in a LaTeX  file that are not in this file will be mapped to
the default font. All RTF fonts listed in this file will be in every
RTF file header whether used or not.  Lines starting with a `#'
character are ignored. After the `.' everything is ignored to end of
line.   To add a RTF font not used as substitute for a LaTeX
font -- for example a Symbol font used in `direct.cfg' -- use a dummy
LaTeX  name like in the following
     Dummy3,MathematicalSymbols.
    Make sure you use the correct font name. Take care of spaces in
font names. The default fonts are named Roman `\rm', Slanted `\sl',
Sans Serif `\sf', Typewriter `\tt', or Calligraphic `\cal'. 


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Language Configuration,  Prev: Font Configuration,  Up: Configuration

5.7 Language Configuration
==========================

 The file(s) `language.cfg' control the translation of LaTeX 's
"hardcoded" sectioning names. The standard LaTeX  styles have some
fixed Title names like `Part', `Reference' or `Bibliography' that
appeared in English or German in the output with the original
versions of LaTeX2RTF .   It is unlikely that you will need to
create a new `language.cfg' file. However, just look at one of the
existing files and follow the pattern. The format is really simple.

6 Error Messages and Logging
****************************

 As stated in the Debugging section, LaTeX2RTF  provides a means to
control  the amount of debugging information through the `-d#'
switch.   By using a debugging level of 4, you can get a pretty good
idea of what LaTeX  command caused the problem and what line that
command might be found on.   
`Fatal error messages'
     indicate a bug in the source code. PLEASE report them, if they do
     not apear in the documentation (*note Reporting Bugs::). 

`Error messages'
     always abort the program and are caused by conditions that
     prevent further conversion of the input file.  Typically this is
     cause by LaTeX2RTF  getting hopelessly confused by the number of
     braces in the LaTeX  file. 

`Warning messages'
     inform you, that there is some conversion loss from LaTeX  to RTF,
     or that the output file has some restrictions on some RTF
     Readers. Most of these  warnings can be supressed by add the
     offending command to the `ignore.cfg' file.
    Error and Warning messages should follow the GNU Coding
standards, i.e. they have the format
     inputfile':line: Error|Warning: message
    You can also control the level of debugging output by inserting
`\verbositylevel{#}' in the LaTeX  file.  This is very handy if you
have a large LaTeX  file that is failing in only a small section.
For example,
     problem free latex file ....
     \verbositylevel{5}
     problematic code
     \verbositylevel{0}
   will cause a huge amount of debugging information to be emitted
for the problematic code.  Error reporting and logging still has
many inconsistencies, but it gets better with each release. Don't
try to make any sense in debugging levels above 4, these are for my
own delight only and can change significantly between versions. 
The `inputfile' may be incorrectly identified if it is incorporated
through `\input' or `\include'.  The line may be also be wrong at
times.  *Note Known Bugs::.

7 History & Copyright
*********************

 In 1994 the first Version of LaTeX2RTF  was written by Fernando
Dorner and Andreas Granzer of the Viena University supervised by Ralf
Schlatterbeck in a one-semester course. They created a simple LaTeX
parser and added most of the infrastructure for the program. This was
version 1.0 of LaTeX2RTF .  In 1995, work on LaTeX2RTF  was continued
in another one-semester course by Friedrich Polzer and Gerhard
Trisko. The result was LaTeX2RTF  version 1.5.  Ralf Schlatterbeck
(ralf "at" zoo.priv.at) maintained and extended LaTeX2RTF  until
1998.  In 1998 Georg Lehner (jorge_lehner "at" gmx.net) found the
reference to LaTeX2RTF  on the TeX Conversion Webpage
(http://tug.org/utilities/texconv/index.html) of Wilfried Hennings
and added some functionality and took over the maintainence of the
program.  The last version release by Georg is 1.8aa. The bulk of
development post 1.8aa was done by Scott Prahl.   Wilfried Hennings
now coordinates the development of the program and maintains the
project on SourceForge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/)
where there are also (low volume) mailing lists for users and
developers. Mailing via one of these lists requires  subscription to
the list (to prevent spam). For subscription to these lists visit the
page: users list
(http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/latex2rtf-users) or
developers list
(http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/latex2rtf-developers) 
As of February 2010, version 2.1.0 of LaTeX2RTF  is available.  
The contents of this manual were composed by copying shamelessly what
was available in the original sources and documentation.

8.1 Unimplemented Features
==========================


   * LaTeX2RTF  ignores some optional parameters of `\documentstyle' 

   * Add the code to produce the corresponding chapter, section, and
     page numbering with headings and myheadings pagestyles.
     Implement `\markboth' and `\markright'.

   * To support `\tableofcontents' there would be two approaches:
     Transfer sectioning information, title text and then produce page
     numbers by the rtf- reader. Scan and label all of the sectioning
     commands while reading and then construct the sectioning
     information using these labels. Needs two passes on LaTeX
     input.
   


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Missing options,  Next: Known Bugs,  Prev: Unimplemented Features,  Up: LaTeX2RTF under Development

8.2 Missing options
===================

 Missing or buggy command line options. 
     

`-d'
     Information logging and Error reporting is not implemented
     consistently. Need to test and track problems with the
     linenumber and with the file name. 

`--long_names'
     It would be useful to implement the GNU long option names, e.g.:
     `-debug', `-output_file', `-quiet', etc.  This could be done by
     switching to the GNU getopt package.
   


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Known Bugs,  Next: Reporting Bugs,  Prev: Missing options,  Up: LaTeX2RTF under Development

8.3 Known Bugs
==============


  1. The first parameter of a \link{anchor}[ltx]{label} is converted
     to the rtf-output. Label is stored to hyperref for later use,
     the optional parameter is ignored. [ltx] should be processed as
     Otfried recommends it, to use for exclusive LaTeX  output.e.g:
     \link{readhere}[~\Ref]{explaining: chapter}. Since
     {explaining:chapter} is yet read by LaTeX  and hyperlatex when
     [...] is evaluated it produces the correct reference. LaTeX2RTF
     is only strolling from left to right through the text and can't
     remember what she will see in the future.

  2. The diagnostics routine does not output the correct (actual)
     input filename. (`.aux', `.bbl', `\input').
        


File: latex2rtf.info,  Node: Reporting Bugs,  Next: Todo List,  Prev: Known Bugs,  Up: LaTeX2RTF under Development

8.4 Reporting Bugs
==================

 Report bugs to to the bug tracking system at SourceForge
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/).  Only report bugs for
the latest version of LaTeX2RTF  that is available.    Please provide
the following information and observe the following guidelines when
reporting a bug in the program:
  1. State the version of LaTeX2RTF  that you are using.  You can get
     the version by specifying the `-V' option to LaTeX2RTF .  

  2. Specify the your operating system and version. Be sure to check
     the file `Makefile' for settings that may be specific to your
     machine, especially for some versions of SunOS there may be
     settings which are needed to compile successfully. Do this before
     submitting a bug report. 

  3. If the program produces wrong output or does not work for you,
     include a short LaTeX  file along with a description of the
     problem.  Isolating the bug into a small LaTeX  file does two
     things.  First, it provides a file that can be used to test
     future versions of LaTeX2RTF  and second, it certainly improves
     the chances that the bug will get some attention.  Do not send
     me large LaTeX  or RTF files, I simply do not have the time to
     wade through large files to search for a bug! 

  4. Be patient. I am maintaining the program in my free time. I did
     not write most of the code. Often I do not have the time to
     answer to your question. I will, however, try to fix reported
     bugs in upcoming releases.
