latex2rtf is a translator program that translates LaTeX text into the
RTF format used by several textprocessors, including Microsoft Word
and Word for Windows.  

It was written by Fernando Dorner and Andreas Granzer 
in a one-semester course in our department.  
It was later updated in another one-semester course 
by Friedrich Polzer and Gerhard Trisko.  
Ralf Schlatterbeck <ralf@zoo.priv.at> maintained and extended
it until 1998.  
It was then extended (1998-1999) and maintained (1998-2001)
by Georg Lehner <jorge_lehner@gmx.net>.
Further extensions, resultiung in version 1.9a, 1.9c, 1.9d, 1.9e 
by Scott Prahl <prahl@ece.ogi.edu>.

For the Copyright of the Program see the file Copyright.

The documentation of the program is found in the doc/ directory in the
file latex2rtf.info in the GNU info format.  For your convenience find
a HTML and a PDF version of the manual there.
(In versions 1.9a to 1.9e, only the HTML version was updated, 
so we removed the other, outdated documentation from these versions.)

To install (on a UNIX system)
- Edit Makefile for your local configuration. The install part supports
  multiple directories to install to, you will normally only need one.
  Be sure to correctly configure the LIBDIR variable to the directory
  where support files (ending in .cfg) will be found by the program.
  This is normally the same as the LIBINSTALL variable.
- make
- make install
- If you have problems with make install (for example if your mkdir
  doesn't support the -p option) and you do not need multiple install
  targets, try:
  make simple_install
- If this is not your first-time installation, you may want to preserve
  you configuration (*.cfg) files. Copy them to a safe place and issue
  the command
  make install_and_delete_old_cfg
  (If you have problems with mkdir or other problems as above, use the
  make-target "simple_cfg_install")
- Try the program and report any errors to the address below.
- Define the environment variable RTFPATH this is typically /usr/local/lib/latex2rtf
- Run make test to test your installation

Reporting bugs:
Please give the following information and observe the following
guidelines when reporting a bug in the program to the homepage
at Sourceforge
              http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/

* Give the version of the program
  - For the executable you get the version by specifying the -V option
    to latex2rtf
  - For the sources the version is the version number of the file
    version.h
* The Operating System and version number where you are running or
  trying to install latex2rtf. Be sure to check the file Makefile for
  settings that may be specific to your machine, especially for some
  versions of SunOS there may be settings which are needed to compile
  successfully. Do this BEFORE writing to me.
* For problems with the DOS version, report installation problems to the
  mainainer of the DOS port, Vladimir Menkov, vmenkov@cs.indiana.edu
* If the program produces wrong output or does not work for you, include
  a SHORT latex file along with a description of the problem. DO NOT
  send me large latex or rtf files, I simply do not have the time to
  wade through large files to search for a bug! If necessary (i.e., the
  program produces wrong or invalid RTF), send the rtf file that is
  produced along with the latex input file.
* Be patient with me. I am maintaining the program in my free time. I
  did not write most of the code. Often I do not have the time to
  answer to your question. I will, however, try to fix reported bugs
  in upcoming releases.

Version 1.9a, 1.9c, 1.9d, 1.9e: Scott Prahl <prahl@ece.ogi.edu>

=========================================================================
The MSDOS / MS Windows version described in the following is also 
available from http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/
=========================================================================

1. Download latex2rtf-1.9e_DOS.zip and unpack it.

2. Put the executable (latex2rt.exe) to the directory where you 
   plan to run in, or to a directory that's listed in your PATH
   environment variable.

3. Put the configuration files (*.cfg) to the directory where you 
   plan to run latex2rtf, or to a directory that's listed in your
   RTFPATH environment variable. 
   Use MS DOS set command to set it, but take care of the special
   syntax (coding of drive letter and slash instead of backslash)
   which is required by the DJGPP compiler:
    set RTFPATH=/dev/C/l2r/cfg

4. Read user's guide in latex2rt.txt, or at least run
        latex2rt -?
   to see the list of options and argument order.
