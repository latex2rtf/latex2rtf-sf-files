\section{Inline equations}

First begin with simple \verb#$# delimited equation such as
$x+y=w$ as an example.  All the equations in this section should
look identical.

Next how about a simple \verb#\begin{math}# delimited equation such as
\begin{math}x+y=w\end{math} as an example.  All the equations in this section should
look identical.

Now consider \verb#\(# and \verb#\)# delimited equation such as
\(x+y=w\) as an example.  All the equations in this section should
look identical.

\section{Unnumbered equations}

I will start with a simple \verb#$$# wave equation
that will have no number
$$
\nabla^2 \phi -{1\over c} {\partial \phi\over \partial t}  = 0
$$
This is followed by a \verb#displaymath# environment
\begin{displaymath}
\nabla^2 \phi -{1\over c} {\partial \phi\over \partial t}  = 0
\end{displaymath}
Here is an example of the \verb#\[# displaymath environment
\[
\nabla^2 \phi -{1\over c} {\partial \phi\over \partial t}  = 0
\]


\section{Numbered equations}
Next comes an \verb#equation# environment
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 \phi -{1\over c} {\partial \phi\over \partial t}  = 0
\end{equation}
Note that \verb#\nonumber# in an \verb#equation# environment still gets
an equation number
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 \phi -{1\over c} {\partial \phi\over \partial t}  = 0 \nonumber
\end{equation}
